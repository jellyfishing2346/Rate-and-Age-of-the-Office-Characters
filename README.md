  # Rate and Age of the Office
    #### Video Demo:  < https://youtu.be/hOgZeHw_yC4 >
    #### Description:
    This is my CS50 python final project. I created a project where I check
    the command line arguments if its three sufficient arugments
    where it will access the names, traits, and characters
    I listed for the Office characters.
    If its less than three arguments it prints too few arguments
    where as if its more than it prints too many arguments.
